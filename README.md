### Our Motivation(s):
- A large group of people huddled around a tiny space with 25 small 4x2” cards is a recipe for Chaos. 
- We want to simplify this experience where no-one feels left out or claustrophobic and maybe even stream the board to other devices like a smart-TV.
- In doing so we wanted to expand this experience to play the game remotely with friends anywhere on the globe that has internet access.

### Concept:
This Website and its Application is inspired by the popular Family-Night Board Card Game: “Codenames”.
We Strive to bring the Fun to Users Electronically with Reactive Platforms ranging from passing a Simple/Single Devise around the Room to connecting User’s TVs and Phones anywhere in the United States!

### User Stories:
- As a User/Player I need to be able to create a virtual room for playing the game.
- As a User I would like to have options to customize this game-room for the most appropriate interactions and level-of-difficulty with my fellow players.
- As a User I would like to customize/personalize components of our room upon creation as well as player’s individual credentials.
- As a User I need to clearly navigate through the game’s cite and find/understand components with their roles/rules.
- As a User I want there to be clear options for Key-master rotations with indicators of who they are as well as validators to best avoid cheating.
